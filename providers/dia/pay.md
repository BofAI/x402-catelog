## Spend-Aware Usage

- Request one asset per call; cache short-term as prices update on a seconds-to-minutes cadence.
- Use the on-chain address endpoint for long-tail tokens, the symbol endpoint for majors.

## When Not To Use

- Do not use for DEX-pair-level liquidity/new-launch data (use a DEX data provider).

## Integration Notes

- Cache responses according to the upstream data freshness needs.
- Prefer specific token, pair, protocol, pool, or address routes over broad dump/search routes when possible.
- Treat market, yield, and security data as decision support, not as the only execution signal.
- The public catalog entry only documents public routes and does not include runtime configuration or wallet material.
