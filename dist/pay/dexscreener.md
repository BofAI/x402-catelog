## Request Examples

- `GET /providers/dexscreener-dex-data-tron/latest/dex/tokens/{tokenAddresses}`
- `GET /providers/dexscreener-dex-data-tron/latest/dex/search?q=SUN`
- `GET /providers/dexscreener-dex-data-tron/token-profiles/latest/v1`

## Response Shape

- Returns DexScreener JSON: pairs with priceUsd, liquidity.usd, volume, fdv, pairCreatedAt, and chain/dex identifiers.

## Code Usage

Call the catalog route with any HTTP client. Example:

```bash
curl -sS 'https://tm-x402-gateway.bankofai.io/providers/dexscreener-dex-data-tron/latest/dex/search?q=SUN'
```

Equivalent route form:

```text
GET https://tm-x402-gateway.bankofai.io/providers/dexscreener-dex-data-tron/latest/dex/search?q=SUN
```

## Spend-Aware Usage

- Query by specific token/pair address instead of broad search where possible to reduce payload and noise.
- For new-launch monitoring, poll token-profiles on a sensible interval (not every second); each poll is a paid call.

## When Not To Use

- Do not use as a security check (pair listing != safe); pair with a security provider before trading.

## Integration Notes

- Cache responses according to the upstream data freshness needs.
- Prefer specific token, pair, protocol, pool, or address routes over broad dump/search routes when possible.
- Treat market, yield, and security data as decision support, not as the only execution signal.
- The public catalog entry only documents public routes and does not include runtime configuration or wallet material.
